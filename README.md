### Labs

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

- [OTW Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) - Over The Wire Wargames. A bunch of SSH servers with capture-the-flag like challenges to do. Start with Bandit and work your way up. (Great for absolute beginners)

- [NPS Labtainers](https://nps.edu/web/c3o/labtainers) - Naval Postgraduate School's docker framework that they use for their MS in cyber security degree. Great for practicing real skills inside of virtual machines. Best route to get these working is to get a Ubuntu VM running (20.04 LTS worked for me) and then let their install script configure everything for you.

- [HTB](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) - Hack The Box is an online platform allowing you to test your penetration testing skills and exchange ideas and methodologies with thousands of people in the security field. (GREAT resource once you somewhat know what you're doing... beginners, don't start here)
